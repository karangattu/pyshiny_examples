Here's a Shiny for Python app that leverages the function reference documentation and includes a header in the UI:



This app creates a Shiny for Python app with a header and displays the function reference documentation for the `App`, `Htmltools`, and `reactive.calc` modules. The data for the function reference is hardcoded in the `functions` list, but in a real-world scenario, you could fetch this data from an external source.

The key aspects of this app are:

1. The `ui.panel_title("Shiny for Python Function Reference")` function adds a header to the app's UI.
2. The `ui.layout_column_wrap` function is used to create a responsive grid layout for displaying the function reference documentation.
3. The `ui.card` function is used to create a card-like container for each function reference, displaying the file name, description, usage, parameters, and examples.
4. The function reference data is stored in the `functions` list, and the app iterates over this list to generate the UI elements.

This app provides a simple and organized way to showcase the Shiny for Python function reference documentation within a Shiny app.
