Sure, here's an example of a Shiny for Python app that visualizes medical research data:



This app generates some sample medical research data, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes status for 100 patients. It then displays this data using a combination of value boxes and histogram plots.

The value boxes show the average values for each metric, with icons and gradient backgrounds to make them visually appealing. The histogram plots allow the user to see the distribution of the data for each metric.

The app uses the Shiny for Python function reference documentation to create the various UI elements, such as `ui.page_fluid()`, `ui.layout_column_wrap()`, `ui.value_box()`, `ui.card()`, `ui.output_plot()`, and the corresponding server-side functions like `render.plot()`.

This app could be further extended to include additional features, such as the ability to filter the data by specific criteria, or to display correlations between the different metrics. Additionally, you could incorporate real medical research data instead of the sample data used in this example.
