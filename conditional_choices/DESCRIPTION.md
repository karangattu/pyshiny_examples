Here's an example Shiny for Python app that dynamically updates input choices based on another input:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface, which includes a dropdown for selecting the pet type and another dropdown for selecting the pet name.
2. The `server` function contains the logic for the app.
3. The `update_pet_names` function is a reactive effect that is triggered whenever the `pet_type` input changes. It updates the `pet_name` input with the corresponding pet names based on the selected pet type.
4. The `selected_pet` function is a reactive text output that displays the selected pet type and name.

When the user selects a pet type, the `update_pet_names` function is triggered, and the `pet_name` input is updated with the corresponding pet names. When the user selects a pet name, the `selected_pet` function is updated to display the selected pet type and name.

This example demonstrates how to use Shiny for Python's reactive programming features to dynamically update input choices based on another input, without the need for external data files.
