Here's a Shiny for Python app that includes a paragraph of text in the UI and uses made-up data:



In this app, we first define some made-up employee data in the `data` variable. This data is then used in the `server` function to create a `DataGrid` output.

The `app_ui` defines the user interface of the app, which includes a Markdown paragraph and the `employee_table` output.

When you run this app, it will display the paragraph of text and a table of the employee data.
