Here's a Shiny for Python app that creates a histogram using randomly generated data:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface, which includes an input slider to control the number of observations and an output plot to display the histogram.

2. The `server` function defines the server-side logic. The `@render.plot` decorator is used to mark the `plot` function as a reactive plot output.

3. Inside the `plot` function, we generate random data using `numpy.random.randn()` and then create a histogram using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()` and `matplotlib.pyplot.hist()`. The number of observations is controlled by the input slider.

4. The `App` class is used to create the Shiny app, passing in the `app_ui` and `server` functions.

When you run this app, it will display a slider input and a plot output. As you adjust the slider, the histogram will update in real-time to reflect the new number of observations.

This app demonstrates the basic structure of a Shiny for Python app, including how to use input controls, create reactive plot outputs, and generate random data for visualization. You can further customize the app by adding more input controls, modifying the plot appearance, or incorporating additional functionality as needed.
