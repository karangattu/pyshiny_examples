Here's a Shiny for Python app that creates a bar chart using `matplotlib` with some made-up data:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface, which includes an input slider to control the number of bars in the chart and an output plot to display the chart.

2. The `server` function defines the server-side logic. The `@render.plot` decorator is used to mark the `bar_chart` function as a reactive plot output.

3. Inside the `bar_chart` function, we generate some random data for the chart. The number of bars is determined by the value of the input slider.

4. We then create the bar chart using `matplotlib` and return the figure object, which will be displayed in the Shiny app.

When you run this app, you'll see a slider that allows you to adjust the number of bars in the chart. As you move the slider, the chart will update dynamically.
