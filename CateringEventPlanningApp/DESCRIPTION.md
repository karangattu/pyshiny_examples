Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app for a catering and event planning app:



This app includes the following features:

1. **Event Details**: Users can select the event type, date range, and number of guests.
2. **Menu Selection**: Users can select menu items from different categories (appetizers, entrees, sides, and desserts).
3. **Event Summary**: The app displays a summary of the selected event details and menu items.
4. **Download Invoice**: Users can download the event summary as an invoice.
5. **Dashboard Metrics**: The app displays some key metrics related to upcoming events, total revenue, and booked capacity.

The app uses sample data for the menu items, event types, and event capacities. The `get_available_dates` function generates a list of available dates with a random boolean flag indicating if the date is available.

When the user selects the event details and menu items, the app checks if the selected date is available and generates an event summary. The user can then download the summary as an invoice.

The dashboard metrics are updated based on the sample data and the user's selections.
