Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that creates a stock market dashboard using the function reference documentation:



This app includes the following features:

1. **Value Boxes**: The app displays three value boxes that show the total market cap, the top performing stock, and the worst performing stock. These value boxes use the `ui.value_box()` function and include icons and gradient backgrounds.

2. **Stock Prices Plot**: The app includes a plot that displays the stock prices for selected stocks. The user can select which stocks to display using the `ui.input_selectize()` function.

3. **Stock Performance Plot**: The app includes a plot that displays the stock performance over a selected date range. The user can select the date range using the `ui.input_date_range()` function.

The app uses the `generate_stock_data()` function to create some sample stock data, which is then used throughout the app. The `server()` function defines the logic for the two plots, using the `render.plot()` decorator to render the plots.

This app demonstrates how you can use the Shiny for Python function reference documentation to create a stock market dashboard app with various interactive features and visualizations.
