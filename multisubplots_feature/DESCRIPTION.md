Here's an example Shiny for Python app that creates a plot with multiple subplots using made-up data:



In this example, we first generate some sample data using `numpy.random.normal()` to create three different datasets. Then, in the `server` function, we define a `plot()` function that creates a figure with three subplots using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()`. We plot a histogram for each dataset in the respective subplot, set the titles, and then return the figure.

The `app_ui` defines the layout of the app, which includes a single card element that displays the plot. The `ui.layout_column_wrap()` function is used to ensure the card takes up the full width of the page.

When you run this app, it will display a plot with three subplots, each showing a histogram of the corresponding dataset.
