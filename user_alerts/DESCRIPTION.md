Sure, here's an example Shiny for Python app that leverages the function reference documentation and uses alerts to display messages to the user:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface, which includes input fields for name, age, and city, as well as a submit button and a placeholder for the output.
2. The `server` function contains the logic for the app.
3. When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the `@reactive.effect` decorator ensures that the code inside the function is executed.
4. The `req()` function is used to ensure that the user has provided values for all the input fields.
5. The code then searches the `data` list for a matching person based on the input values.
6. If a matching person is found, a success message is displayed using `ui.notification_show()` with a "message" type.
7. If no matching person is found, an error message is displayed using `ui.notification_show()` with an "error" type.
8. The `@render.ui` decorator is used to define the output, which in this case is an empty `div` element.

This app demonstrates how to use the `ui.notification_show()` function to display alerts to the user, and how to leverage the Shiny for Python function reference documentation to build a simple app.
