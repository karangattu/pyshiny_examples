Sure, here's an example Shiny for Python app that uses `seaborn` to create a more visually appealing plot:



Here's how the app works:

1. We first generate some sample data using `numpy.random.normal()` to create two variables `x` and `y`, and store them in a dictionary `data`.

2. The `app_ui` defines the user interface of the app, which includes an input slider to control the number of bins in the histogram, and an output plot to display the bivariate histogram.

3. The `server` function defines the server-side logic of the app. The `@render.plot` decorator is used to mark the `plot()` function as a reactive plot output. Inside the `plot()` function, we use `seaborn.histplot()` to create a bivariate histogram of the `x` and `y` variables, with the number of bins controlled by the input slider. We also set the title and axis labels for the plot.

4. Finally, we create the Shiny app using `App(app_ui, server)`.

When you run this app, you should see a Shiny app with a slider input and a plot output. As you adjust the number of bins using the slider, the plot will update in real-time, providing a more visually appealing and interactive experience for the user.
