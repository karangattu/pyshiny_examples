Here's a Shiny for Python app that leverages the function reference documentation and uses `shiny.ui.row` and `shiny.ui.column` for flexible layouts:

This app has the following features:

1. The main UI is divided into two rows using `shiny.ui.row` and `shiny.ui.column`.
2. The first row displays the title "Shiny for Python Function Reference".
3. The second row has two columns:
   - The left column contains a dropdown select input to choose a function.
   - The right column displays the details and description of the selected function.
4. The server-side logic retrieves the function details and description from the `function_data` list and renders them in the corresponding output elements.
5. No external data files are used, as the function data is defined directly in the app.

You can run this app using the following code:

```bash
shiny run app.py
```

This will start the Shiny app and open it in your default web browser.
