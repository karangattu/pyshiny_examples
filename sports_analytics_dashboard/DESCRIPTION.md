Sure, here's an example of a Shiny for Python app that creates a sports analytics dashboard using the function reference documentation:



This app includes the following features:

1. **Value Boxes**: The app displays several value boxes that show the total games played, wins, losses, points for, and points against for all the teams.
2. **Team Statistics Table**: The app displays a table that shows the individual team statistics, including games played, wins, losses, points for, and points against.
3. **Points For vs Points Against Plot**: The app displays a scatter plot that shows the relationship between points for and points against for each team.

The app uses the Shiny for Python function reference documentation to create the various UI elements, such as `ui.value_box()`, `ui.card()`, `ui.output_table()`, and `ui.output_plot()`. The server-side logic is implemented using the `@render.table` and `@render.plot` decorators, which leverage the function reference documentation for the `render` module.

The data used in this app is generated randomly, but you can replace it with your own sports analytics data if available.
