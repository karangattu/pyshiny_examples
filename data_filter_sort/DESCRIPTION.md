Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that allows users to filter and sort a dataset:



Here's how the app works:

1. The app generates a sample dataset using Pandas, with columns for Name, Age, City, and Salary.
2. The UI includes input controls for filtering by name, age range, and city, as well as sorting by name, age, or salary in ascending or descending order.
3. The server-side logic uses the `@reactive.calc` decorator to define a `filtered_data()` function that applies the user's filters and sorting to the original dataset.
4. The `@render.data_frame` decorator is used to render the filtered and sorted data as a `DataGrid` output.

When the user interacts with the input controls, the app automatically updates the displayed data table to reflect the applied filters and sorting.

This app demonstrates how to use Shiny for Python's reactive programming model, input controls, and data table rendering capabilities to build a simple but powerful data exploration tool.
