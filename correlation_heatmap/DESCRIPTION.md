Here's a Shiny for Python app that creates a heatmap to show correlations in a randomly generated dataset:



Here's how the app works:

1. The app generates a random dataset using `numpy.random.rand()` and stores it in a `pandas.DataFrame` called `data`.
2. The `app_ui` defines the layout of the app, including a panel title and a card that will hold the correlation heatmap.
3. The `server` function defines a reactive plot function `correlation_heatmap()` that uses `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` to create a heatmap of the correlation matrix of the `data` DataFrame.
4. The `App` class is used to create the Shiny app, passing the `app_ui` and `server` functions as arguments.

When you run this app, it will display a heatmap that shows the correlations between the features in the randomly generated dataset.
