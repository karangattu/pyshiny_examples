Here's a Shiny for Python app that leverages the function reference documentation and uses `req()` to ensure input values are valid before proceeding. The app will display information about the Shiny for Python functions and allow the user to interact with some made-up data.

Here's how the app works:

1. The user enters a function name in the input text field and clicks the "Search" button.
2. The `function_info` function is called, which first checks if the user has entered a function name using `req()`. If the input is empty, an error message is displayed.
3. The function then loops through the `FUNCTION_DATA` list and checks if the `File Name` matches the user's input (case-insensitive). If a match is found, the function information is displayed using Markdown formatting.
4. If no match is found, a message is displayed indicating that no information was found for the given function name.

The app uses the `req()` function to ensure that the user has entered a function name before proceeding with the search. This helps to provide a better user experience by validating the input and preventing the app from trying to display information for an empty or invalid function name.

You can customize the `FUNCTION_DATA` list to include more Shiny for Python function information as needed. Additionally, you can modify the UI and server logic to add more features or functionality to the app.
