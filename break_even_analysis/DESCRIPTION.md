Here's a Shiny for Python app that performs a break-even analysis based on some made-up data:



This Shiny app calculates the break-even point for a business based on fixed costs, variable costs, and selling price. It provides:
- Break-even units: The number of units that must be sold to cover costs.
- Break-even revenue: The total revenue required to break even.
- Interactive plot: Visualizes revenue and cost curves to illustrate the break-even point.

### Features
- User-input fields for:

- - Fixed costs
- - Variable cost per unit
- - Selling price per unit
- Automatic calculation and display of break-even units and revenue
- Interactive plot updates in real-time based on user input

### Usage
Enter your fixed costs, variable cost per unit, and selling price per unit.
The app will calculate and display the break-even units and revenue.
Explore the interactive plot to visualize the break-even point.

To run the app, save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run the following command in your terminal:

```
shiny run app.py
```

This will start the Shiny app and open it in your default web browser.
