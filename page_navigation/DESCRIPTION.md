Here's an example Shiny for Python app that leverages the function reference documentation and uses a navigation bar to switch between pages:



In this example, the `function_docs` list contains sample function reference documentation, similar to the one you provided. The `app_ui` defines the navigation bar with two pages: "Home" and "Function Reference".

The "Home" page simply displays a welcome message. The "Function Reference" page uses the `ui.output_data_frame` to display the function reference documentation in a table.

The `server` function defines the `function_reference` render function, which returns the `function_docs` list as a data frame to be displayed in the "Function Reference" page.

To run the app, save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run the following command in your terminal:

```
shiny run app.py
```

This will start the Shiny app, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

You can navigate between the "Home" and "Function Reference" pages using the navigation bar at the top of the app.
