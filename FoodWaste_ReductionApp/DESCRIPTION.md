Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that addresses the requirements for a food waste reduction and recovery app:



Here's how the app works:

1. The app generates some sample data for food items, their waste, and recovered amounts. This data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame called `food_waste_data`.

2. The app's UI is defined using Shiny's UI functions. It includes:
   - Two value boxes that display the total waste and total recovered amounts.
   - A card that displays the food waste and recovery data in a table.

3. The server function simply returns the `food_waste_data` DataFrame to be displayed in the table.

The key features of this app are:

1. **Data Visualization**: The value boxes provide a high-level overview of the total waste and recovered amounts, while the data table gives a more detailed view of the individual food items.

2. **Reactive Updates**: The app is built using Shiny's reactive programming model, which means that the UI updates automatically when the underlying data changes.

3. **Scalability**: The app can easily be extended to handle larger datasets or additional features, such as the ability to filter or sort the data.

4. **Accessibility**: The app uses Bootstrap's responsive design and accessibility features, making it easy to use on a variety of devices and accessible to users with disabilities.

To run the app, save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run the following command in your terminal:

```
shiny run app
```

This will start the app and open it in your default web browser.
