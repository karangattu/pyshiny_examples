Sure, here's an example Shiny for Python app that applies basic CSS styling to the UI elements and uses made-up data:



In this example, we create a Shiny for Python app with the following features:

1. **CSS Styling**: The app uses custom CSS classes to style the UI elements, including the cards, buttons, and data table. The CSS is defined within the `ui.tags.style()` block and applied to the relevant UI components.

2. **Data Summary**: The app displays three value boxes that show the total number of entries, average age, and average score of the data. The value boxes use different themes and showcase icons to make them visually distinct.

3. **Data Table**: The app displays the data in a table format, using the `ui.output_table()` component and applying the `custom-table` CSS class to style the table.

4. **Refresh Data**: The app includes an action button that, when clicked, refreshes the data with new randomly generated values.

The app uses a made-up dataset stored in the `data` variable, which is updated whenever the "Refresh Data" button is clicked.

To run the app, save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run the following command in your terminal:

```
shiny run app
```

This will start the Shiny app and open it in your default web browser.
