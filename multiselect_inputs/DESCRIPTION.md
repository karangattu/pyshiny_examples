Here's a Shiny for Python app that meets the requirements you provided:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface of the Shiny app. It includes:
   - A `ui.input_selectize` widget that allows the user to select multiple options from the `choices` list.
   - A `ui.output_text_verbatim` widget that displays the selected options.
   - A `ui.output_table` widget that displays a table of the sample data.

2. The `server` function defines the server-side logic of the Shiny app. It includes:
   - A `@render.text` function that displays the selected options as a string.
   - A `@render.table` function that creates a pandas DataFrame from the sample data and displays it as a table.

3. The `App` class is used to create the Shiny app and run it.

In this app, the user can select multiple options from the `ui.input_selectize` widget, and the selected options will be displayed in the `ui.output_text_verbatim` widget. The `ui.output_table` widget will display a table of the sample data, which is generated programmatically within the app.

Note that this app does not use any external files for accessing data, as per your requirement. The sample data is generated within the app using a dictionary comprehension.
