Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that filters a dataset based on user input:



Here's how the app works:

1. The app generates a sample dataset using Pandas and NumPy. The dataset has 5 columns: Name, Age, Gender, and Income.
2. The app UI consists of a card with various input controls for filtering the dataset: Name, Minimum Age, Maximum Age, Gender, Minimum Income, and Maximum Income.
3. The server function defines a `filtered_data` function that takes the user inputs and applies the corresponding filters to the dataset. The filtered dataset is then returned and displayed in the output.

To use the app, simply run the code and it will start the Shiny app. You can then interact with the various input controls to filter the dataset and see the results in the output.
