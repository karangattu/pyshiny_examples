Sure, here's an example of a Shiny for Python app for an employee performance evaluation app:



This app has the following features:

1. **Value Boxes**: The app displays three value boxes at the top, showing the total number of employees, the number of employees with "Exceeds Expectations" performance rating, and the number of employees with "Needs Improvement" performance rating.

2. **Filters**: The app provides three filters: department, performance rating, and years of service. These filters allow the user to view the employee data based on their selection.

3. **Employee Table**: The app displays a data table with the employee data. The table is editable, allowing the user to update the performance rating, years of service, and last review date for each employee. The table also supports sorting, filtering, and pagination.

4. **Data Validation**: The app validates the user input when editing the table. It ensures that the performance rating is one of the predefined values, the years of service is an integer between 1 and 10, and the last review date is in the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD).

The app uses the Shiny for Python library to create the user interface and the server-side logic. The sample data is generated within the app, but in a real-world scenario, you would typically fetch the data from a database or other data source.
