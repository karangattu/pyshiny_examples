Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that implements a quiz app with dynamic questions:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `quiz_data` list contains the quiz questions, options, and answers.
2. The `app_ui` defines the layout of the app, including the question container, options container, result container, and a "Next Question" button.
3. The `server` function handles the logic of the app:
   - The `current_question_index` reactive value keeps track of the current question index.
   - The `question_container`, `options_container`, and `result_container` render functions display the current question, options, and result, respectively, based on the current question index.
   - The `_` reactive effect listens for the "Next Question" button click and updates the `current_question_index` to move to the next question.

When the user clicks the "Next Question" button, the app will display the next question, options, and the result of the previous question. Once all questions have been answered, the app will display a message indicating that there are no more questions.

This app demonstrates the use of Shiny for Python's reactive programming model, UI components, and data handling. The quiz questions and answers are defined directly in the code, but you can easily modify the `quiz_data` list to include your own questions and answers.
