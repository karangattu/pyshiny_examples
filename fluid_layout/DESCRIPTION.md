Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that leverages the function reference documentation and uses a fluid page layout:



In this app, we first define a list of mock data for the function reference documentation, which includes the file name, usage, description, and examples for each function.

The `app_ui` uses a fluid page layout with a `panel_title` and a `layout_column_wrap` to display the function reference documentation in a responsive grid. Each function reference is displayed as a `value_box` with the file name as the title, the usage as the value, the description as the additional text, and the examples as the showcase. The `theme` and `full_screen` options are used to style the value boxes.

The `server` function is left empty, as there is no interactive functionality in this app.

When you run this app, you should see a fluid page with the function reference documentation displayed in a responsive grid layout. You can click on the full-screen icon in the top-right corner of each value box to expand it to fit the viewport.
