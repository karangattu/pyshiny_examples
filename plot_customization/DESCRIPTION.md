Here's a Shiny for Python app that allows you to customize the plot colors and labels:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface, which includes:
   - A card with input controls for customizing the plot colors and labels.
   - An output area for displaying the plot.

2. The `server` function defines the server-side logic:
   - The `plot` function generates the plot using the sample data and the customization inputs from the user.
   - The `@render.plot` decorator ensures that the plot is rendered in the output area.

3. The `App` class is used to create the Shiny app and run it.

When you run this app, you'll see a user interface with input controls for customizing the plot colors and labels. As you change the values in the input controls, the plot will update in real-time to reflect the changes.

This app demonstrates how you can leverage Shiny for Python to create interactive data visualization applications. The function reference documentation provided earlier can be used to explore the various UI components and server-side functions available in Shiny for Python, which can help you build more complex and feature-rich applications.
