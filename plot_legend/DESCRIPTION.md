Here's a Shiny for Python app that includes a legend for the plot and uses generated data:



In this app, we first generate some sample data using NumPy. The `app_ui` defines the layout of the app, which includes a `card` with the plot and a footer that contains the legend.

The `server` function defines the `plot` function, which creates a matplotlib plot with the generated data and adds a legend to the plot.

When you run this app, you should see a plot with a legend at the bottom of the card.
