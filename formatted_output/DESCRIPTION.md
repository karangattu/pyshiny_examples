Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that meets the requirements you provided:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface of the app. It includes an `input_text` widget for the user to enter some text, and an `output_text_verbatim` widget to display the formatted output.

2. The `server` function defines the server-side logic of the app. It includes a `render.text` function that takes the user's input from the `text_input` widget and formats it with some HTML tags (in this case, wrapping the text in a `<strong>` tag).

3. The `App` function is used to create the Shiny app, passing in the `app_ui` and `server` functions.

When you run this app, it will display a text input field where the user can enter some text. As the user types, the output will update to display the entered text in a formatted way (with the text wrapped in a `<strong>` tag).

This app demonstrates the basic structure of a Shiny for Python app, including the use of input and output widgets, and the ability to create custom server-side logic to process and format the user's input.
