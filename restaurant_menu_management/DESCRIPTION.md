Here's a Shiny for Python app that meets the requirements for a restaurant and menu management app:



This app has the following features:

1. **Restaurants**: The app displays a list of restaurants, and when a restaurant is selected, it shows the restaurant's name, cuisine, and the menu items for that restaurant.

2. **Add/Update Restaurant**: The app allows users to add a new restaurant by entering the restaurant name and cuisine.

3. **Add/Update Menu Item**: The app allows users to add a new menu item by selecting a restaurant, entering the menu item name and price.

The app uses sample data for restaurants and menu items, which are stored in the `RESTAURANTS` and `MENU_ITEMS` lists, respectively. The app does not use any external files for accessing data, as per the requirements.

The app uses various Shiny for Python functions, such as `ui.page_fluid()`, `ui.layout_column_wrap()`, `ui.card()`, `ui.input_select()`, `ui.output_text_verbatim()`, `ui.output_data_frame()`, `ui.input_text()`, `ui.input_numeric()`, `ui.input_action_button()`, `reactive.calc()`, `render.text()`, `render.data_frame()`, `reactive.effect()`, `reactive.event()`, and `ui.notification_show()`.

To run the app, save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run the following command:

```
shiny run app
```

This will start the Shiny app and open it in your default web browser.
