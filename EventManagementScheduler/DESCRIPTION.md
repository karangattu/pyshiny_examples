Sure, here's an example of a Shiny for Python app for an event management and scheduling app:



This app has the following features:

1. **Event Calendar**: The main feature of the app is the event calendar, which displays all the events in the `events` list. Users can click on an event to see its details.

2. **Event Details**: When an event is selected, the app displays the event details, including the name, start time, and end time. Users can also edit or delete the event from this section.

3. **Event Counts**: The app displays the number of upcoming and past events using value boxes.

Here's how the app works:

1. The `events` list contains sample event data, including the event name, start time, and end time.
2. The `calendar_events` reactive calculation returns the list of events.
3. The `calendar` function renders the event calendar using the `ui.calendar` function, and the `on_event_click` parameter is used to call the `show_event_details` function when an event is clicked.
4. The `selected_event` reactive value stores the currently selected event.
5. The `event_details` function renders the event details based on the selected event.
6. The `edit_event` and `delete_event` functions handle the editing and deletion of events, respectively.

Note that this app does not use any external files for accessing data, as requested. The event data is stored in the `events` list within the app.
