Here's an example of a Shiny for Python app that implements an interactive calculator:



This app has the following features:

1. **Input Fields**: The app has two numeric input fields (`num1` and `num2`) and a dropdown select input (`operation`) for the user to enter the numbers and select the operation to perform.
2. **Calculation**: The `result` function uses the input values and the selected operation to perform the calculation and return the result as a string.
3. **Output**: The calculated result is displayed in the `output_text` widget.

Here's how the app works:

1. The user enters two numbers in the `num1` and `num2` input fields.
2. The user selects the desired operation from the `operation` dropdown.
3. As the user interacts with the inputs, the `result` function is automatically recalculated and the output is updated.
4. If the user selects "Divide" and enters 0 as the second number, the app will display an error message.

This app demonstrates the use of various Shiny for Python functions, including `ui.page_fluid()`, `ui.layout_column_wrap()`, `ui.card()`, `ui.input_numeric()`, `ui.input_select()`, `ui.output_text()`, `@render.text()`, and `@reactive.calc()`.

You can run this app using the following command:

```
shiny run app.py
```

This will start the Shiny server and open the app in your default web browser.
