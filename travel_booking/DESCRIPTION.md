Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that allows users to book flights and hotels:



Here's how the app works:

1. **Flight Booking**:
   - The user selects the departure and arrival cities, as well as the departure and return dates.
   - The `available_flights()` function filters the `FLIGHTS` data to find the matching flights based on the user's selections.
   - The `flight_summary()` function displays the available flights.
   - The `book_flight()` function generates a booking summary for the first available flight.

2. **Hotel Booking**:
   - The user selects the city and the number of nights they want to stay.
   - The `available_hotels()` function filters the `HOTELS` data to find the hotels in the selected city.
   - The `hotel_summary()` function displays the available hotels and the total cost for the selected number of nights.
   - The `book_hotel()` function generates a booking summary for the first available hotel.

The app uses the Shiny for Python function reference documentation to create the various UI elements and server-side logic. It also demonstrates how to use reactive calculations, render functions, and download buttons to provide a seamless user experience.

Note that this is a basic example, and in a real-world application, you would likely want to add more features, such as the ability to select specific flights and hotels, handle user authentication and payment, and provide more detailed booking information.
