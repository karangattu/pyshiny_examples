Here's a Shiny for Python app that displays the selected choice from a dropdown:



In this app, we first define the sample data for the dropdown in the `choices` list. Then, in the `app_ui`, we create an `input_select` dropdown with the `choices` and an `output_text` element to display the selected choice.

In the `server` function, we define a `selected_choice` render function that takes the selected value from the `input.dropdown()` and displays it in the `output_text` element.

When you run this app, you'll see a dropdown with the sample options, and when you select an option, the selected choice will be displayed below the dropdown.
