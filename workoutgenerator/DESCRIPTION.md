Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that generates a workout routine based on some made-up data:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `workouts` dictionary contains some sample workout data, organized by type (Cardio, Strength, Flexibility).
2. The app UI includes:
   - A multi-select dropdown to choose the workout types
   - A slider to set the workout duration
   - Checkboxes to include a warm-up and cool-down
   - An output area to display the generated workout routine
3. The `server` function generates the workout routine based on the user's selections:
   - It retrieves the selected workout types, duration, and warm-up/cool-down options from the inputs.
   - It then creates a list of workout items, including the warm-up and cool-down if selected, and randomly selects 2 exercises from each chosen workout type.
   - Finally, it returns the formatted workout routine as a string to be displayed in the output area.

When the user interacts with the app, the workout routine is dynamically generated and updated in the output area.
