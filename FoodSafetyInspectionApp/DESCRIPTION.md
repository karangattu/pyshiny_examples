Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that addresses the requirements for a food safety and inspection app:



This app provides an overview of food safety inspections, including the total number of inspections, the number of passed and failed inspections, the average inspection score, and a table displaying the detailed inspection data.

Here's a breakdown of the key features:

1. **Value Boxes**: The app uses `ui.value_box()` to display the high-level metrics, such as total inspections, passed inspections, failed inspections, and average inspection score. These value boxes are styled using the `theme` parameter and include icons to provide visual context.

2. **Filtering**: The app includes input controls for filtering the inspection data by date range, violation type, and inspection status. These filters are applied to the data frame before rendering the inspection table.

3. **Inspection Table**: The app uses `render.DataGrid()` to display the filtered inspection data in a table format. The table includes features like sorting, filtering, and pagination.

4. **Data Generation**: The app generates sample inspection data using Pandas and random functions, as no external data source is provided. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with actual inspection data from a database or an API.

To run the app, save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and execute the following command in your terminal:

```
shiny run app
```

This will start the Shiny app and open it in your default web browser.
