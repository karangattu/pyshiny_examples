Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that displays summary statistics of a dataset:



Here's how the app works:

1. We first generate some sample data using Pandas and NumPy. This data will be used in the app.
2. The `app_ui` defines the layout of the app, which includes:
   - A panel title "Summary Statistics"
   - Two value boxes displaying the number of rows and columns in the dataset
   - A card displaying the summary statistics of the dataset
3. The `server` function defines the logic for the app. In this case, we use the `@render.table` decorator to display the summary statistics of the dataset using the `data.describe().T.reset_index()` method.
4. Finally, we create the Shiny app using `App(app_ui, server)`.

When you run this app, you should see a Shiny app with the following features:

- Two value boxes displaying the number of rows and columns in the dataset
- A table displaying the summary statistics of the dataset, including the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile, and maximum for each column.

You can customize this app further by adding more functionality, such as allowing the user to select which columns to display, or adding visualizations of the data.
