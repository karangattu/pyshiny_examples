Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that leverages the function reference documentation and uses HTML tags to customize the UI. I've made up some data for use in the app.



In this app, we have a sample data set that represents information about different functions. The UI is divided into two main sections:

1. **Function Selection**: This section allows the user to select a function from a dropdown list. When a function is selected, the details of the function are displayed in a card-like UI element.

2. **Function Image**: This section displays an image related to the selected function. In this case, I've used a placeholder image, but you could replace it with a real image or a plot generated based on the selected function.

The key points in this app are:

1. **HTML Tags**: I've used HTML tags to customize the UI, such as adding a border, radius, and margin to the function card, and setting the width and height of the function image.

2. **Reactive Rendering**: The `function_details` and `function_image` functions use the `@render.ui` and `@render.image` decorators, respectively, to reactively render the UI elements based on the user's selection.

3. **Sample Data**: Since you mentioned not to use external files for accessing data, I've created a sample data set in the Python code. In a real-world scenario, you could fetch the data from an API or a database.

You can run this app using the Shiny for Python command-line interface:

```
shiny run app.py
```

This will start the app and open it in your default web browser.
