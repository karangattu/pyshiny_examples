Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that leverages the function reference documentation and adds spacing between UI elements:



Here's how the app works:

1. The app generates some sample data using a pandas DataFrame.
2. The UI is divided into two main sections:
   - The first section displays three value boxes with different metrics calculated from the data (average score, highest score, and lowest score).
   - The second section displays a data table and a data summary.
3. The `server` function defines two output functions:
   - `data_table` returns the DataFrame to be displayed in the data table.
   - `data_summary` returns a string with the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.
4. The `ui.layout_column_wrap` function is used to create a responsive grid layout for the value boxes and the card components.
5. The `class_="mb-4"` attribute is added to the value boxes and cards to add spacing between the UI elements.

The key points in this app are:

1. Leveraging the Shiny for Python function reference documentation to create the UI and server components.
2. Generating sample data within the app instead of using external files.
3. Using the `ui.layout_column_wrap` function to create a responsive grid layout.
4. Adding spacing between UI elements using the `class_="mb-4"` attribute.

This app demonstrates how you can use Shiny for Python to build interactive applications with custom data and a clean, organized UI.
