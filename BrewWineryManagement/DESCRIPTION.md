Here's a Shiny for Python app for a brewery and winery management app:

This app has the following features:

1. **Overview**: The app displays three value boxes showing the total number of breweries, total number of wineries, and the total production across all breweries and wineries.

2. **Brewery and Winery Tables**: The app has two tabs, one for breweries and one for wineries. Each tab displays a data table with the relevant information (name, location, founded, and production).

3. **Dynamic Data Updating**: When the user switches between the "Breweries" and "Wineries" tabs, the corresponding data table is updated dynamically.

The app uses the sample data provided for breweries and wineries. The data is stored in Python dictionaries and converted to Pandas DataFrames for display in the data tables.

The key Shiny for Python functions used in this app are:

- `ui.page_fluid()`: Creates a fluid page layout.
- `ui.value_box()`: Displays a value box with a title, value, and an optional showcase.
- `ui.tabs()` and `ui.tab_panel()`: Creates a tabbed interface.
- `ui.output_data_frame()`: Displays a data frame in the UI.
- `render.data_frame()`: Renders a data frame to be displayed in the UI.

This app provides a basic structure for a brewery and winery management application. You can further enhance it by adding features such as:

- Ability to add, edit, and delete breweries and wineries.
- Detailed views for individual breweries and wineries.
- Analytics and visualizations for production, sales, and other metrics.
- User authentication and authorization.
