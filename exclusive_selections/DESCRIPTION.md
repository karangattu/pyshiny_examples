Here's a Shiny for Python app that meets the requirements you provided:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `data` list contains some sample data with information about people, including their name, age, gender, and salary.
2. The `app_ui` defines the user interface, which includes a radio button group for filtering the data by gender.
3. The `server` function defines the server-side logic. The `data_table` function is a reactive function that filters the `data` list based on the selected gender and returns the filtered data as a table.
4. The `App` class is used to create the Shiny app and run it.

When you run this app, you'll see a page with a radio button group that allows you to filter the data by gender. The table below will update automatically as you change the selected gender.

This app demonstrates the use of radio buttons for mutually exclusive selections, and the use of reactive functions to update the output based on user input. The data is generated within the app, so there's no need for external files.
