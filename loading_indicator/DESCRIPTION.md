Sure, here's an example Shiny for Python app that includes a progress bar to indicate loading status:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface, which includes an "Load Data" button, a table output, and a progress bar output.
2. The `server` function contains the logic for the app.
3. When the "Load Data" button is clicked, the `load_data` function is executed.
4. Inside the `load_data` function, a `ui.Progress` object is used to display a progress bar. The progress bar is updated in a loop, simulating the loading of data.
5. After the progress bar reaches 100%, the sample data is displayed in the table output.
6. The `progress_bar` function renders the HTML for the progress bar, which is displayed in the `output_ui` element.

The progress bar is implemented using a combination of the `ui.Progress` class and some HTML/CSS. The `ui.Progress` class provides a convenient way to manage the progress bar, allowing you to set the progress value, message, and other properties.

In this example, the progress bar is displayed as a striped and animated bar, which is a common visual indicator of a loading or processing state. The progress bar's width is updated dynamically to reflect the current progress.
