Sure, here's an example Shiny for Python app that creates a reactive dataframe based on user selections:



Here's how the app works:

1. The app generates some sample data in a pandas DataFrame `df`.
2. The UI consists of a left-hand side card with various input controls for filtering the data, and a right-hand side card that displays the filtered data.
3. The `filtered_df()` function is a reactive calculation that filters the original `df` based on the user's input selections.
4. The `filtered_data()` function is a render function that displays the filtered DataFrame in the right-hand side card.

When the user interacts with any of the input controls, the `filtered_df()` function is automatically re-executed, and the `filtered_data()` output is updated to reflect the new filtered data.

This app demonstrates how to create a reactive dataframe based on user selections without the need for external data files. The data is generated within the app itself, but you can easily modify the code to use real data from a database or other source.
