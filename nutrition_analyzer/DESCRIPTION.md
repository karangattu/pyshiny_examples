Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that provides a nutrition analysis and labeling feature using the function reference documentation:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface of the app, which includes:
   - Three `value_box` components that display the total calories, total fat, and dietary fiber information.
   - A `card` component that displays the nutrition facts table.
   - A `card` component that displays the nutrition label.

2. The `server` function defines the server-side logic of the app:
   - The `nutrition_table` function renders the nutrition facts table using the `render.table` decorator.
   - The `nutrition_label` function renders the nutrition label using the `render.ui` decorator.

3. The `App` class is used to create the Shiny app and run it.

The app uses the Shiny for Python function reference documentation to create the various UI components and server-side logic. The sample data for the nutrition information is generated programmatically within the app, without the need for external files.

When you run this app, you'll see the nutrition analysis and labeling features displayed in the browser. The value boxes provide a quick overview of the key nutrition information, while the nutrition facts table and label provide more detailed information.
