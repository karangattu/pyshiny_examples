Here's a Shiny for Python app that allows the user to change the plot colors based on their input:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the layout of the app, which consists of two cards. The first card contains two color input controls, one for the line color and one for the background color. The second card contains the plot output.

2. The `server` function defines the logic for the app. The `@render.plot` decorator is used to create a reactive plot that updates whenever the line color or background color changes.

3. Inside the `plot` function, we generate some sample data (a sine wave) and plot it using Matplotlib. We use the color values from the user inputs to set the line color and background color of the plot.

4. The `App` class is used to create the Shiny app and run it.

When you run this app, you should see a plot of a sine wave. You can use the color input controls to change the color of the line and the background of the plot in real-time.
