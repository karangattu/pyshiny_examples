Sure, here's an example of a Shiny for Python app that performs a treatment efficacy analysis using made-up data:



This app generates some sample data for a treatment efficacy analysis, where there are three treatment groups: 'Drug A', 'Drug B', and 'Placebo'. The outcome variable is normally distributed, with a higher mean for the active treatment groups compared to the placebo group.

The app UI consists of the following elements:

1. Two value boxes displaying the overall mean outcome and the treatment effect (difference in mean outcome between active treatments and placebo).
2. A bar plot comparing the mean outcome for each treatment group.
3. A histogram showing the distribution of the outcome variable.

The server function defines two plot functions that generate the treatment comparison and outcome distribution plots using Matplotlib.

When you run this app, you should see the following:

- Two value boxes displaying the overall mean outcome and the treatment effect.
- A bar plot comparing the mean outcome for each treatment group.
- A histogram showing the distribution of the outcome variable.

You can interact with the app by observing the values and plots, which will update based on the generated sample data.
