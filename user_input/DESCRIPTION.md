Sure, here's an example Shiny for Python app that uses a text input to get user-entered text and displays some made-up data based on the input:



Here's how the app works:

1. The `app_ui` defines the user interface, which includes a text input for the user to enter a product name and an output area to display the product information.

2. The `server` function contains the logic for the app. The `@render.text` decorator is used to mark the `product_info` function as the output for the text display.

3. The `@reactive.event(input.product)` decorator ensures that the `product_info` function is re-executed whenever the user changes the text input.

4. Inside the `product_info` function, the user-entered product name is retrieved from the `input.product()` call. The function then checks if the product is in the `data` dictionary, and if so, it returns a formatted string with the product information. If the product is not found, it returns a message indicating that no information is available.

5. The `App` class is used to create the Shiny app and run it.

When you run this app, you'll see a text input field where the user can enter a product name. As the user types, the output area will update with the corresponding product information (or a message if the product is not found).

Note that this example uses made-up data for the product information, but in a real-world scenario, you could replace the `data` dictionary with data from a database, an API, or any other data source.
