Sure, here's a Shiny for Python app that leverages the function reference documentation and uses `plotnine` for data visualization. I've created some sample data for the app.



This app has three main components:

1. **Function Reference**: A value box that displays information about the Shiny for Python function reference.
2. **Data Visualization**: A value box that displays a scatter plot with lines, using the `plotnine` library and the sample data.
3. **Inputs**: A value box that contains input controls for selecting a category and adjusting the x and y ranges of the plot.

The `server` function defines the logic for the app. The `plot` function uses `ggplot` from `plotnine` to create the scatter plot with lines, and it updates the plot based on the user's input selections.

When you run this app, you'll see the three value boxes, and you can interact with the app by selecting a category and adjusting the x and y ranges of the plot.
