Sure, here's an example Shiny for Python app that displays a subset of a dataframe based on filters:



In this example, we first generate a sample dataframe `df` with some employee data. The app UI consists of a column layout with a card for the filter options and another card for the filtered data.

The filter options include:
- Name filter (input text)
- Minimum and maximum age (input numeric)
- City filter (input select)
- Minimum and maximum salary (input numeric)

The `server` function defines a `filtered_data` function that applies the filters to the original dataframe and returns the filtered dataframe. The `render.data_frame` decorator is used to display the filtered data in the second card.

When the user interacts with the filter inputs, the `filtered_data` function is automatically re-executed, and the displayed dataframe is updated accordingly.

This example demonstrates how to use Shiny for Python to create a simple data filtering application without the need for external data files. The data is generated within the app, and the filtering logic is implemented in the server function.
